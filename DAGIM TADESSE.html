          This is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.My name is Dagim tadesse.which includes six people. My habits are play football.
          I came from a very big family; it includes my father, my mother, my three brother,and me. Most of the families have only two to three kids, but mine has five kids. The reason for that is my grandmother liked boys more than girls, and the first kid was a girl which is my sister, second one is me, then the third one is a girl again, so my grandmother was not very satisfied with only one boy, then my parents decided to try one more time, and that was a big surprise because it was a boy and a girl at the same time.
          I am now one of the students in addis ababa  university. two years ago. I moved from  addis ababa to Adama for the secondary education. My grades in addisababa were not very good, and my plan  was to choose one of the easiest high schools, but my father suddenly told me that he wanted me to study harder and he was working in government office, so he decided to move me to Adama city  without asking me. So, I have been studying in Adama for more than four years.
       I like to play football  very much. I used to be the football team member for the passed four years in adama, my football skills were very bad, and after my coach’s training, I became an okay basketball player. At the beginning of the year, our team was not very good because our team was new and we did not know anything about team work, but we got better and better when the time passed. I learned how to play football and how to play in a team form my four years football training, and all of our team members were having fun during all the practices and games.
          Finally, I am not a student who loves to study or like to study at all. Some of my friends think that I like to study because my grades are good but in fact I do not like to study at all. Everything I do now is for my future I know that I need good grades.

          At Don Bosco school, I have received many awards for my academic achievements. By maintaining a B+ average, I have been awarded an honor roll certificaticate for the past four semesters. In grade 11,I was selected as the citizenship pillar award winner. My greatest fulfillment and pride comes from my volunteer work both in and outside of school. This year, I have worked on the grad executive and played a key role as on organizer and participant in the ICT competition. But my biggest commitment has been to the school interact club. Since grade 8, I have worked with my peers to raise money for local and international causes. <br>
          Our school celebrates a technical festival of a national level which in this region is amongst the most popular one’s in which about 500 students from over 10 schools participant in various fun and technical events, models exhibition, paper presentation, cultural, dance and drama shows. I was amongst the team of chief coordinators consisting of 10 members, all from 12th grades batch of student and ultimately we organized it as a grand success and won praise and accolades for the sooth conduct and flawless events management, from teachers, visitor and participating students  like.

          Well, I’m here to tell you that even a little knowledge of HTML and CSS can make a big difference in your career. And learning tech isn’t just for the production assistants and print designers of the world—whether you’re a small business owner, a sales manager, an event coordinator, or even a magician, you can benefit from some HTML and CSS chops.
          But, first, let’s review what exactly HTML and CSS are. The short and sweet version is: HTML and CSS are the foundations of the web. HTML—“Hyper Text Markup Language”—is the language used to tell your web browser what each part of a website is. So, using HTML, you can define headers, paragraphs, links, images, and more, so your browser knows how to structure the web page you’re looking at.
          CSS—“Cascading Style Sheets”—is the language that gives those web pages their look and formatting. In other words, CSS is what you use to make sites look nice with fancy fonts, rich colors, gorgeous backgrounds, and even slick animations and 3D effects.
          Easy, right? But you’re probably still wondering: How am I supposed to use these coding languages in my student career? Well, here are just a few of the amazing things you can achieve with just a few lines of these easy-to-learn languages. This all reasons are make me design this simple website.
